# Quantum Machine Learning and Information Processing

This repository provides the source code of some analytical and numerical implementations of the PhD thesis *Quantum Machine Learning and Information Processing*.

Most of the code is written by the Wolfram Language in the form of [Mathematica notebook](PhD-Thesis.nb).
<!-- , which can be also run online here.  -->
Some of the code is implemented by Python and Julia (To be uploaded).

This is the very initial version, detailed comments of the code will be updated in the near future.

# Recommended Environment
